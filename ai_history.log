Q: don't know passwrd
Docs used: Effivity Pro - Reset Password.txt, Effivity - Create New Users.txt
A: I'd be happy to help you with your password issue. However, the documentation provided only covers how to reset passwords through the Effivity domain page and how to create new users in Effivity.

Since you mentioned you don't know your password, I recommend following the steps in the "Reset Password" document. Here's a simplified version:

1. Go to the Effivity domain page by opening the URL: https://www.effivity.com/WebApp/account/domain
2. Enter your respective domain
3. Choose the "Forgot Password" option
4. Enter your email ID and submit
5. A password reset link will be sent to the email you entered

Please follow these steps to reset your password. If you have any further issues or concerns, feel free to reach out to Effivity Tech Support at support@effivity.com.
